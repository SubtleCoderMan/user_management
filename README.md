# user management
##### _(feb-march 2022)_
For this project i wanted to make a user management system as a proof of concept and to test&refine my PHP skills.

### Some things to note
* you require XAMPP or a similar program to run this
* you must set up a database with a table named "users", with the fields "ID" (primary INC), "first_name", "last_name", "nickname", "password" and "email".
* you must set your name password and all in assets/dbinfo.php
* This is not secure at all, passwords are basically stored as plain text.
* Also please note it's just a proof of concept.

# Site navigation
Now i'll briefly explain the pages
